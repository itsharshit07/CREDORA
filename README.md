## 🚀 Problem Statement
Many individuals, especially young adults and those in rural and urban areas, struggle to understand loans and credit scores. This lack of financial literacy leads many into debt traps. People are often unaware of whether they qualify for a loan or how to maintain a good credit score.

To address this issue, we have developed **Credora**, a smart AI-powered financial guide that acts as a personal assistant to help users navigate the complexities of loans, credit scores, and budget tracking. Credora provides real-time recommendations on saving, borrowing, and repaying, fostering a more financially stable community.
